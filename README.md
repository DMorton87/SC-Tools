# SC-Tools
Used AI, tkinter, python-docx, and simpledialog to build a multi-tool GUI app that processes Word files with zero command-line experience required. As a result, the amount of time my teachers had to spend preparing their lessons went from four days of prep for two people down to about 4-6 hours for one person.
